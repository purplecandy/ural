# Ural

Hi! Ural was project for a competetion at my college.

At the time of competetion I used Django as my backend just to get things quickly done, there is nothing really special in it. Right now I have moved the entire project to Flutter only it uses the SQLite as a database and completely relies on the host no internet connection require.

**The Django repository is deprecated please refer Flutter for current source code**
